## Hangman Terminal Game

# Description

Hangman is a popular game that a player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Here a version of this game was implemented to be played in the terminal. The game has two modes:

1 - A user must enter the secret word (useful for playing with more than 1 player);
